## Dependencies

* cmake >= 3.5
 * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1(mac, linux), 3.81(Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools]((https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
* [uWebSockets](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets)
  * Run either `install-mac.sh` or `install-ubuntu.sh`.
  * If you install from source, checkout to commit `e94b6e1`, i.e.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets
    cd uWebSockets
    git checkout e94b6e1
    ```
    Some function signatures have changed in v0.14.x. See [this PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/pull/3) for more details.

* **Ipopt and CppAD:** Please refer to [this document](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/blob/master/install_Ipopt_CppAD.md) for installation instructions.
* [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page). This is already part of the repo so you shouldn't have to worry about it.
* Simulator. You can download these from the [releases tab](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases).
* Not a dependency but read the [DATA.md](./DATA.md) for a description of the data sent back from the simulator.


## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./mpc`.

## State, actuators and update
  
## N e dt
  I choose `N`equals 12 and `dt` equals 0.08. I found that the model worked pretty well using these numbers. Previously, I tried decreasing `dt`, but the model was overfitting and the car was moving a lot. I, then, incremented `dt` to 0.2 but the car was not reacting fast enough and went off road. Regarding `N`, I found that a lower numbers didn't work fine.
## Polynomial fitting and MPC preprocessing
  
## Latency
A contributing factor to latency is actuator dynamics. For example the time elapsed between when you command a steering angle to when that angle is actually achieved. This could easily be modeled by a simple dynamic system and incorporated into the vehicle model. One approach would be running a simulation using the vehicle model starting from the current state for the duration of the latency. The resulting state from the simulation is the new initial state for MPC.
This was the approach I used. The code can be found in the `main.cpp` file (lines 127-140).
